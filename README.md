## How it works

We are simulating a scenario in which a reactive jammer (implemented on an ESP32) attempts to disrupt the communication of a legitimate LoRa device at the physical (PHY) layer. The jammer continuously scans all channels for a LoRa preamble, and upon detection, immediately transmits a jamming signal to interfere with the ongoing transmission. This constitutes a denial-of-service (DoS) attack on the legitimate communication.

The primary goal of the project is not merely to demonstrate the attack, but to explore detection and mitigation strategies that can be implemented on the legitimate device. The intention is to make these strategies adaptable to various hardware platforms, including devices like the Sodaq ExpLoRer, ESP32-based LoRa modules, and potentially others.

When running the system, the setup involves an active jammer attempting to disrupt communication, while the legitimate device tries to detect the attack and respond through adaptive mechanisms that either avoid, withstand, or neutralize the interference.

## Installation

How to install and run the project

To run this setup, ensure the following requirements are met:

- A TTN (The Things Network) server must be properly configured, with support for OTAA (Over-The-Air Activation) for all participating devices.
- The following hardware and software components are required:

1. ESP32 with SX1276 LoRa Chip
   - Required Arduino Libraries:
     - `LoRa` by Sandeep Mistry
     - `RadioLib` by Jan Gnomes
   - Board Manager:
     - `ESP32` by Espressif Systems
2. Sodaq ExpLoRer with RN2483 LoRa Module

   - Required Arduino Libraries:
     - `Sodaq_wdt` by GabrielNotman, SODAQ
   - Board Manager:
     - `SODAQ SAMD Boards` by SODAQ

3. Dragino LPS8N LoRaWAN Gateway
   - Must be registered and connected to the TTN network using OTAA.

### Installation

1. Clone the Repo:
2. (Recommended) Use the Arduino IDE and install the relevant libraries and board managers
3. Connect your devices to your PC via USB
4. Compile and flash the devices with the code provided
5. When the code has been flashed, the devices should be up and running

## Usage

In the code for the legitimate devices and the jammer, there are some configuraitons that can be changed and reflashed onto the devices. For the Sodaq, it has the following:

```cpp
// Transmission strategy types
#define STRATEGY_STANDARD 0         // No ACK, standard transmission
#define STRATEGY_RETRY 1            // With ACK and fixed retries
#define STRATEGY_DYNAMIC_SF 2       // With ACK Dynamic spreading factor adjustment               
#define STRATEGY_DYNAMIC_SF_RETRY 3 // With ACK Dynamic spreading adjustment and fixed retries

// Set the active transmission strategy here
#define ACTIVE_TRANSMISSION_STRATEGY STRATEGY_STANDARD // swap out the STRATEGY_STANDARD
```

The jammer has two modes, one that targets frequencies only and another that hops between spreading factors as well:

```cpp
// Jamming strategy types
#define DEFAULT_JAMMING 0 // Jams frequencies between 867.1 - 868.5 (EU863-870)
#define DYNAMIC_JAMMING 1 // Jams frequencies between 867.1 - 868.5 (EU863-870) and spreading factors 9 - 12

// Set the active jamming strategy here
#define JAMMING_STRATEGY DEFAULT_JAMMING // swap out the DEFAULT_JAMMING
```

### Logging

When using the Arduino IDE's Serial Monitor, you can observe detailed information about jamming attempts as well as the detection and mitigation strategies being applied in real time. On the Sodaq device, LED indicators also provide a quick visual reference for various error states, making it easy to determine whether a transmission was successful or if interference occurred.

## Acknowledgements

This project draws inspiration from a previous bachelor's project that explored a similar setup involving an ESP32-based jammer and a Sodaq ExpLoRer device as the legitimate node. While we acknowledge and appreciate the foundational ideas from that work, the codebase used here has been extensively reworked and significantly expanded, resulting in a solution that is substantially different in both structure and implementation.

Additionally, we make use of the Sodaq_RN2483 library to interface with the LoRa module on the Sodaq device. Minor modifications have been made to the library to better suit the needs of this project, while the core functionality remains largely unchanged. We extend our thanks to the original authors for their work.
